# CCNA_Notes_Bharath

This repository contains my personal study notes and CLI command references while preparing for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** exam. These notes are written in a simplified, easy-to-understand format and will be updated frequently based on my day-to-day learning.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Project

- Built as part of my self-paced learning and revision for the **CCNA certification**
- Notes are written in plain language to make complex topics easier to understand
- Focused on practical usage, command syntax, and real-world scenarios
